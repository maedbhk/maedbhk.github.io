title: About Us
---

This site is powered by PhD students in the Department of Psychology at UC Berkeley. We are a diverse group of students studying cognition, social-personality, development, clinical science, cognitive and behavioural neuroscience. Our interests range from basic circuit-level neurobiology to sleep to developmental disorders.

We are conducting great research that has wide appeal to a broad audience. We want to disseminate our findings and ideas in a way that is accessible and engaging to everyone!

We update this page regularly with graduate student spotlights and opinion pieces contributed by psychology graduate students in the department.

If you would like to contribute to this collaborative effort or if you have any questions, please contact maedbhking@berkeley.edu.
