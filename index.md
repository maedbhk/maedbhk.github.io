  ## Berkeley Psychology Blog
---

This blog is powered by PhD students in the Department of Psychology at UC Berkeley. We are a diverse group of students studying cognition, social-personality, development, clinical science, cognitive and behavioural neuroscience. Our interests range from basic circuit-level neurobiology to sleep to developmental disorders.

We are conducting great research that has wide appeal to a broad audience. We want to disseminate our findings and ideas in a way that is accessible and engaging to everyone!
