This blog is powered by PhD students in the Department of Psychology at UC Berkeley

We are a diverse group of students studying cognition, personality, development, clinical science, cognitive and behavioural neuroscience. Our interests range from basic circuit-level neurobiology to sleep to developmental disorders

There is some pretty great research being conducted in our department and our goal is to disseminate our findings to a wider audience
